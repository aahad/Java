<b>Exception Handling: </b>

Its an object created by Java when a program produces an error. A thread 
is created by Java that keeps an eye on the flow of your program. If the
flow is disrupted, Java creates the exception object.

Local Exception Handler: Created by Java in case if programmer has not 
provided a handler. It shows the user why the error occured. It also 
stops the program.

Example1:
<i>class temp {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int d = 0;
    int a = 42 / d;
  }
}</i>

Output1:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
        at temp.main(temp.java:4)

java.lang.Throwable
* Exceptions
* Errors

<b>try and catch blocks: </b>

To control an exception by yourself, you will have to define 2 blocks:
try {
  ----
}
catch(Exceptionclass e) {   <---- this is like defining an object name
  ----
}

NOTE: An exception is usally denoted as 'e' or 'ee'. This is not required
but is a common practice. Also every try block requires a catch (or finally)
block, or else there will be a compilation error.

When an exception occurs, we say that an exception is thrown and Java goes
to the catch block and looks for the catch defined for that exception.

Example1:
<i>import java.util.Random;

class HandleError {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int a=0, b=0, c=0;
    Random r = new Random();

    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
      try {   // The try block has code that you fear might generate exceptions
        b = r.nextInt();
        c = r.nextInt();
        a = 12345 / (b/c);
      } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Division by zero. " + e);
        a = 0; // set a to zero and continue
      }
      System.out.println("a: " + a);
    }
  }
}</i>

Output1:
Division by zero. java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
a: 0
Division by zero. java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
a: 0
a: 12345
Division by zero. java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
a: 0
Division by zero. java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
a: 0
Division by zero. java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
a: 0
Division by zero. java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
a: 0
a: 2469
a: -12345
a: 1234

NOTE: We are using random numbers, so the result will be different every time.

Also keep in mind that Java cannot print an object as such. It uses the toString 
class described in the Object class to be able to print. Since Exceptions are
also objects, they use the toString method is used in the background and thus
you are able to use the System.out.println to print the Exception.


Example2:
<i>class MultiCatch {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try {
      int a = args.length;
      System.out.println("a = " + a);
      int b = 42 / a; 	// ArithmeticException
      int c[] = { 1 };
      c[42] = 99;	// ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, c only has one element
    } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Divide by 0: " + e);
    } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
      System.out.println("Array index oob: " + e);
    }
    System.out.println("After try/catch blocks.");
  }
}</i>

Output 2a:
C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Abdul\programs>java MultiCatch
a = 0
Divide by 0: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
After try/catch blocks.

Output 2b:
C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\Abdul\programs>java MultiCatch dodo
a = 1
Array index oob: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
After try/catch blocks.

<b>Exception Hirarchy: </b>

The child exception is described first and the parent exception is 
defined in the end.

	A
       / \
      C   B
     / \
    D	E

So D's catch will be defined first and then C and then A.

Example1:
<i>/*  This program contains an error.
 
   A subclass must come before its superclass in 
   a series of catch statements. If not, 
   unreachable code will be created and a
   compile-time error will result.
*/
class temp {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try {
      int a = 0;
      int b = 42 / a;
    } catch(Exception e) { 	// This is the parent object and should have been last
      System.out.println("Generic Exception catch.");
    }
    /* This catch is never reached because
       ArithmeticException is a subclass of Exception. */
    catch(ArithmeticException e) { // ERROR - unreachable
      System.out.println("This is never reached.");
    }
  }
}</i>

Output1:
temp.java:18: exception java.lang.ArithmeticException has already been caught
    catch(ArithmeticException e) { // ERROR - unreachable
    ^
1 error

NOTE: This occurs at compilation.
The unreachable error means that this line of code can never be executed.
Exception is the parent class in the Object class and all other exceptions
are its children.

<b>Nested Exception Handlers: </b>

try {			<-- try1
  ----
  ----
  try { 		<-- try2
    ----
    ----
  }
  catch (----) {   	<-- catch2
    ----
  }
  ----
  ----
}
catch(----) {		<-- catch1
  ----
}

If an exception occurs in try2 for which a handle is not provided in catch2, 
Java goes to catch1 to look for a handler there and so on, until it reaches the
most outer try/catch block. If no handler is found then Java uses its default 
handler.

But this does not work the other way around. If an exception occurs in try1 for
which there is no defined catch in catch1, Java will not access catch2. This is
because the scope of the try2/catch2 has not been entered.

NOTE: The nested try does not need a catch, it will be fulfilled by the outer
catch block.

Example:
<i>class NestTry {
  public static void main(String lala[]) {
    try {
      int a = lala.length;

      /* If no command line arguments are present,
         the following statement will generate
         a divide-by-zero exception. */
      int b = 42 / a;

      System.out.println("a = " + a);

      try { // nested try block
        /* If one command line arg is used,
           then an divide-by-zero exception 
           will be generated by the following code. */
        if(a==1) a = a/(a-a); // division by zero

        /* If two command line args are used
           then generate an out-of-bounds exception. */
        if(a==2) {
          int c[] = { 1 };
          c[42] = 99; // generate an out-of-bounds exception
        }
      } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
        System.out.println("Array index out-of-bounds: " + e);
      }

    } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Divide by 0: " + e);
    }
  }
}</i>

Output:
When lala.length=1:
a = 1
Divide by 0: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero   <-- read from outer catch block

When lala.length=2:
a = 2
Array index out-of-bounds: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

When lala.length=3:
a = 3

<b>Method called from within a try block: </b>

If while within a try block if the program jumps to another method where there is
a try/catch block, this new try/catch block can access the catch block of the first
try/catch block.

Example:
<i>/* Try statements can be implicitly nested via
   calls to methods. */
class MethNestTry {
  static void nesttry(int a) {
    try { // nested try block
      /* If one command line arg is used,
         then an divide-by-zero exception 
         will be generated by the following code. */
      if(a==1) a = a/(a-a); // division by zero
      // This will call the catch 

      /* If two command line args are used
         then generate an out-of-bounds exception. */     
      if(a==2) {
        int c[] = { 1 };
        c[42] = 99; // generate an out-of-bounds exception
      }
    } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
      System.out.println("Array index out-of-bounds: " + e);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    try {
      int a = args.length;

      /* If no command line args are present,
         the following statement will generate
         a divide-by-zero exception. */
      int b = 42 / a;

      System.out.println("a = " + a);

      nesttry(a);
    } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Divide by 0: " + e);
    }
  }
}</i>
