<b>Primitives Types</b>

Bit - its the minimum size used to store info

Non-floating
* byte 	- 8 bit, -128 to 127, ie. -2^7 to (2^7 -1)
* short - 16 bit, -2^15 to (2^15 - 1)
* int 	- 32 bit 
* long 	- 64 bit

Floating
* float	- 32 bit
* double - 64 bit

Character
* char - 16 bit, 0 to (2^16 - 1)

Boolean
* boolean - true or false 1 bit

Normal numbers are BASE 10, ie 0, 1, 2 .... 9, 10, 11 ...... 20
BASE 8 is 0, 1, 2 ...... 7, 11 .... 17
In Java it is written as 'int i = 0144' 
which is normally written as 144<sub>8</sub>

BASE 16 is written as 0x150 or 0X150 ie 'zero x'
336<sub>10</sub> is written as 150<sub>16</sub> in BASE 16
This is used in graphics programming.

<b>Basic Rules</b>

Lines should end in ';'
b = b * 2;

Java names have to be Unicode
Unicode is a 16 bit naming which can allow other laguages than english for programming

Using $ in front of a variable is allowed, eg. $object but it is not recommended
because when using classes within classes it can cause problems

'-' are not allowed
'_' are allowed, but cannot start name with it

Identifier cannot be a keyword, 
ie. Around 30 to 35  keywords that Java has reserved for itself
Some keywords have been discarded, like goto, const but they 
still cannot be used

To concatenate 2 identifiers 
System.out.print( ID1 + " " + ID2 );

2 + 2 = 4
2 + "2" = 22   <--- This is called Overloading

<b>Literals</b>

Whenever a value is moved inside an Identifier, its called a Literal
eg. int i = 2

int ---- primitive type
i ---- Identifier
2 ---- Literal

The way we interpret this is that 
"the Literal 2 moves into the Identifier i", ie. 2 --> i

<b>Casting</b>

<strike>float ff = 3.1676;</strike>
double dd = 3.1676;
3.1676 is read as a 64 bit number so you can't save it in a float
To save it to a float use: float ff = 3.1676f;

NOTE: Whenever you give a decimal value to JAVA it stores it as 64 bit
      Now since float is 32 bit you can't save the decimal value to a float
      So to save a decimal value to a float you have to use a CAST method
      ie. typing an 'f' at the end of the word .... 3.1676f
      This is called CASTING.

<b>Character Literals</b>

Syntax:
char c = 'a';

char c = 65;  <---- This will input the ASCII value of 65 (which is 'a') into c

<i>class charnum {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    char ch1 = 'a';
    char ch2 = 'b';
    char ch3 = (char)(ch1 + ch2);
    System.out.print(ch3);
  }
}</i>

This adds the ascii values of a & b and returns the character that denotes
the ending ascii value.

In JAVA there is no string variable type. A string is an object.
Therefore there is no easy way to concatenate two character identifiers.


<i>class charnum {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    char ch1 = 'a';
    char ch2 = 'b';
    System.out.print(ch1 + ch2);
  }
}</i>

This will return the ascii NUMBER value of ascii(a) + ascii(b)
