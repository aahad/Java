<b>Recursion: </b>

A method calling itself, hence forming a loop, is known as recursion.

Example1:
<i>public class TestFibonacci {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Fibonacci number of index 7 is "+fib(7));
  }
  public static int fib(int n) {
   if ((n == 1) || (n == 2))
     return 1 ;
   else 
     return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)); 
  }
}</i>

Output:
Fibonacci number of index 7 is 13

NOTE: Fibonacci is the name of a series which works as follows:
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
ie. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5, f(6)=8, f(7)=13

The above program uses recursion to execute the series. fib() calls itself multiple
times again and again until it reaches n=1 or n=2 where the return value is 1. This
is known as the stopping condition.

<b>Inner classes: </b>

A class defined inside the scope of another class.

class Outer{
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Inner inner = new Inner();//line 1
 }
 class Inner {
   Inner() {
    System.out.println("Inside Inner class");
   }
 }
}

When you compile a program with 5 individual classes, 5 separate .class are formed.
Each .class file is issued its own individual memory resource. But if you create 
4 inner classes within a fifth class, 5 classes are generated, but when executed
they will all use the same resource, ie. only one resource object is created.

This is used usually in applets and event handling. Use in applets is understandable
because the fewer classes there are to download, the easier it is for a web user.

NOTE: Its legal to create an inner class within an already inner class, but it is 
not good practice.

<b>Types of Inner classes: </b>

Non-static:
Inner class that belongs to an object of the outer class

Static:
Inner class that belong directly to its outer class

Local inner classes: 
Defined within a method. Cannot be assigned static or non-static.
Its just written as a regular class.

Anonymous Inner Class:
Inner classes with no names. These are generated at run-time.

<b>Non-Static Inner Class: </b>

Example:
<i>class Outer {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Outer outer = new Outer();
  Inner inner = outer.new Inner(); 
  // inner class needs outer class object for creation, referred to as Outer$Inner.class
 }
 class Inner {
   Inner() {
    System.out.println("Inside Inner class");
   }
 }
}</i>

Output:
Inside Inner class
Inside Meth1
Inside Meth2

2 .class files are formed, Outer.class and Outer$Inner.class, but both use the same 
memory resource.

To create the Inner class object we can also use: 
Inner inner = new Outer().new Inner();

Also we can do the following:
Outer() {
 new Inner();
}
class Inner {
 Inner() {
  //
  }
}

</pre>

<b>Static Inner classes: </b>

Example:
<i>class Outer {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Inner inner = new Inner(); // static creating static
 }

 static class Inner { // static object
   Inner() {
    System.out.println("Inside Inner class");
    meth1(); // static calling static

    Outer outer = new Outer(); // creating object for outer class
    outer.meth2(); // object of outer class calling non-static of outer
   }
 }

 static void meth1() {
	System.out.println("Inside Meth1");
 }

 void meth2() {
	System.out.println("Inside Meth2");
 }

}</i>

Output:
Inside Inner class
Inside Meth1
Inside Meth2

<b>Local Inner classes: </b>

Inner class defined within a method. The scope of this class is as long as the method
is running. It is niether static nor non-static.

For a local class to read variable values from either its outer method or outer class,
the variable must be defined as 'final'. Also if you are to call the constructor of 
the local class, it can only be invoked after the local class has been identified. 
If you tried to call the local class's constructor before its body is defined, it will 
look for the class elsewhere.

Example:
<i>class Outer {
 final static int i = 2;
 public static void main(String[] args){
  final String s = "some local string";

  class Local {
   Local() {
    System.out.println(s);
    System.out.println(i);
   }
  }

  Local local = new Local();

 }
}</i>

Output:
some local string
2

2 files are created: Outer.class, Outer$1$Local.class
