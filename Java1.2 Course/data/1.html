<b>Terminology of JAVA</b>

     ** P - Polymorphism
     *  The ability to change with different types of input,
     *  eg. the 'println' command in Java will print integers, strings
     *  This because the println command evaluates differently with different inputs.
     *  eg2. How a person changes his style of speaking as he talks to different people
     *
PIE *** I - Inheritence
     *  When there is a Parent - child relation
     *  The child is more powerful than the parent, the child has the parent's atributes,
     *  as well as its own attributes.
     *
     ** E - Encapsulation
        To be able to use something without understanding all the details of the process
        EG. driver does not know the details of how a car runs.
        A coder hides some of his code so that a regular user does not mess the program.

Class is a combination of methods & variables.

An object is an instance of the Class.

attribute - variables, functions
behavior

<b>Writing your first JAVA program</b>
<i>
class MyClass {
        public static void main (String args[]){
                system.out.println("This is my first program");
        }
}</i>

main - this is the main method
void - this class has no returning values
(String args[]) - This is an argument to give additional information about the method
[] - used for an array
args - its the name of the array, it can have any name besides args

String & system are classes defined in the java.lang package
<i>import java.lang.*</i> means <i>"import all the classes in the lang package inside java"</i>
The lang package is automatically imported in all java programs

system.out.println
system 	- class
out 	- object
println - method

The main method of any program will always have:
<i>public static void main (String args[])</i>
You cannot change anything in the above line except for the <i>args</i> array name
If you did change anything else then you will get the error:
<i>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main</i>

<b>Syntax for a Java program</b>
<i>
package mypackage;
import ------;
class MyClass{
	-----------
	-----------
}
</i>
The filename has to be exactly the same as the class name described in the code.
Java is case-sensitive. Therefore the filename will be MyClass.java

javac - Java Compiler

So now type in <i>javac MyClass.java</i>
A new file Myclass.class will be created in the your current folder.

To run this .class file type <i>java MyClass</i>

<b>NOTE:</b> Do not type <strike>java MyClass.class</strike> 
Java understands it as <i>"look for class in the folder MyClass"</i> as in Unix.

Some very common errors:
* Java is case-sensitive, this causes problems
* Filename of the .java file and the class name defined inside the code is not the same

<b>Primitives Types</b>

Boolean 	- true or false

Character	- char a = '65';

Integer		- Complete numbers
  byte	
  short
  int
  long

Floating	- decimal numbers
  float
  double


This the only thing in JAVA that is not OOP, these are not objects.
These are kept temporarily in memory and are used in fast calculation purposes.

In order for these primitives to survive when we deal with objects, we have to
convert them into objects using WRAPPER classes.
