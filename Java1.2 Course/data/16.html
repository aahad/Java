<b>Casting: </b>

<b>Example1:
		Object
		  |
		  |
		Fruit
		  |
		  |
		Citrus
	implements squeezable
	      /	  |   \
	     /	  |    \
	 lemon Tangelo  Grapefruit
</b>
<i>class fruit {}
class citrus extends fruit implements squeezable {}
interface squeezable {}

class lemon extends citrus {}
class tangelo extends citrus {}
class grapefruit extends citrus {}

public class temp {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
	grapefruit g1, g;
	citrus c;
	tangelo tang;
	g = new grapefruit();
	c = g;
	g1 = (grapefruit)c;  // casting of parent into child
	tang = (tangelo)c; // this causes error at runtime
  }
}</i>

<b>Output1</b> - occurs at runtime, compiles without error:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: grapefruit
        at temp.main(temp.java:17)

NOTE: Since c is pointing to grapefruit. When you write tang = (tangelo)c; 
you are trying to force c to make tang to point to tangelo which is not
possible. This is over-seen by

<b>extends vs implements: </b>

extends is more powerful than implements. Even in the previous example, you can
say that fruit deserves to be a more parent class than squeezable. BUt we can 
also say that both can be the parent of citrus. But since Java does not allow
multiple parents, we choose between the two and make fruit (which seems to be 
more powerful parent) the parent and squeezable the interface.

For defining multiple interfaces you can define it as:
... implements squeezable, squishable ...

<b>Casting to fool compiler: </b>

Example1:
<i>class fruit {}
class citrus extends fruit implements squeezable {}
interface squeezable {}

class lemon extends citrus {}
class tangelo extends citrus {}
class grapefruit extends citrus {}

public class temp {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
	grapefruit g1, g;
	squeezable sq;
	g = new grapefruit(); // g was initialized
	sq = g; // Base class for sq is now grapefruit but compiler does not notice
	g1 = (grapefruit)sq; // casting is only needed to fool compiler
	/* This casting is not needed for runtime, but since compiler
	   will not run without it, we don't have a choice. The 	   
	   compiler looks at the line squeezable sq; and gets confused.	*/
  }
}
</i>

This program runs perfectly without errors.

<b>Garbage Collection: </b>

GarbageCollector (GC) controls memory allocation. 

Thread is an object created by the OS. It is created to do a particular task.
A couple of threads work together to perform a bigger task.

Java assigns priority to every thread created. Priority can be minimum, normal
or maximum. We will talk about this later when studying threads.

When we run a Java program, the main thread is created. The main thread is 
what imports default and user-defined packages. The main method then creates
a Garbage Collector. Garbage Collector has minimum priority whereas the main
method has normal priority.

Garbage collector is created automatically, it works by itself. We cannot control
it, it does what it wants to, or at least what it is supposed to do. 

NOTE: The 2 threads that are created automatically whenever a Java program is 
executed are the main thread and the garbage collector thread. Both these 
threads work assyncronously (not meaning that they work together but that they
work according to a fixed and dedined pattern).

The garbage collector monitors objects in use. It indicates which objects are not
in use. If the object cannot prove the validity of its use in the program, the
garbage collector thinks that the object is just taking up resources for no reason.
Then the GC destroys the object using it finalize method. Although thi smight mean
that it is important for every class then to have a finalize method but this is not
the case. The finalize method is defined for the base class Object, which is used
by the GC to destroy the object.

When the object is no longer reachable from the rest of your program, the GC 
destroys the object from memory.

NOTE: Please understand that <b>THE OBJECT IS DESTROYED</b>, not the reference. The
reference may be shifted to another object. 

The method that initializes the GC thread is:
java.lang.System.gc();
