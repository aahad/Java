<b>final keyword: </b>

final class Myclass --  {  }

This means that this class is the last class in the hierarchy. Therefore,
it cannot be extended (the smallest child).

sqrt(16);  <-- will return 4
This is part of the Math class (that is automatically imported, lang package).
If we think of it as a class, then to use its sqrt method we should have needed 
to extend it, but we don't do that because it is a final class.

A final method is one that the programmer does not want to change. 
final void meth() {----}

You can have a final method in an abstract class but you cannot have
an abstract method in a final class.

Example:
<i>abstract class livingthing {
  abstract void eat();
  abstract void move();
  static final void eyes(){  // final method in an abstract class, has to be static
	System.out.println("I can see");
  }
}

class Animal extends livingthing{

  void eat(){ 
	System.out.println("Living things eat.");
  }

  void move(){
	System.out.println("Living things move.");
  }

  public static void main(String args[]){
	Animal obj1 = new Animal(); 
	obj1.eat();
	obj1.move();
	livingthing.eyes();
  }

}</i>

<b>native keyword: </b>

Java Native Inteface (JNI):
These are METHODS (not classes) used when you need a Java app to talk to
code written in another language (eg. C++)

native void meth();
This will make Java call the JNI and it will look for the method definition.

Even methods like are considered native.

<b>transient: </b>

Can never be serialized, ie. to be sent in a stream like the print stream.
The print stream sends data from the memory to the screen.

transient int i = 9;
So now you will not be able to print i. 

This is used when user does not want the data to be hacked for any reason.
This is io (input/output) thing.

<b>syncronized: </b>

When you need harmony, continuity.

When you are performing multi-threading. Eg. one thread wants to print and another
is trying to delete some of that data. Both of these cannot be done at the same time.
The 2 threads have to be syncronized. 

Every object/thread in Java has a built-in lock. When more than one thread trys to
access a method that has the syncronized keyword, Java asks the thread whether
it has the lock for this method or not. If the method is currently being used
then the lock is being used by the current thread. Once the current thread is done
using the method, the lock is passed over to the next thread. If there are more than
one thread waiting, then the lock goes to the thread with the most priority.

syncronized void update {
  -----
  -----
}

syncronized can be used with a method and when calling an object.
