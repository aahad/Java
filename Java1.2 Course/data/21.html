<b>Thread States: </b>

1) Ready State / Start State
   The thread is ready to start, but is not running yet. 

2) Running State
   This is when the thread is actually running and is waiting for the OS to allow
   it to perform its task, which depends on the thread's priority and on other 
   threads that are already running. The OS needs to monitor it, for which it creates
   its own object.

3) Waiting State
   If the thread is waiting for the OS to allow it to be run, it is in its waiting 
   state. Once the OS allows it to run again, the thread will be in its run state 
   again. The wait state puts it back in its start state and so the thread keeps 
   looping between these three states until the OS allows it to be executed.

4) Dead State
   Once the thread has performed its task, it comes to its dead state. Once the
   thread is in its dead state, it cannot go back to either one of its previous
   states, ie. run, wait or start.

Yielding: It is when a thread goes from its running state to its start state directly
	  using the yield() method. In this case, the thread does not go through its
   	  waiting state.

<b>Scheduling: </b>

Types of Scheduling:

1) Priemptive:
   To run the thread with a higher priority, this what Java uses

2) Time-slicing:
   Equivalent time assigned to each thread and each thread is executed during this
   assigned time. This is what Microsoft used in its previous Operating Systems.
   Problem with it is that it becomes impossible to find out which thread is running
   currently. (Windows 2000 uses Priemptive)

An OS is all about Interrupts. Every trigger or event handler generates an interrupt 
which tells the OS to do what it is supposed to do. Catching interrupts is easier 
with priemtive scheduling than in time-slicing.

<b>synchronized keyword: </b>

lock, monitor

The Object class assigns a lock to all objects. 

public synchronized void method1() {
  -----
  -----
}

When multiple threads aquire a synchronized method of an object, the object gives its
lock to the first thread that aquires it, and the object puts the rest of the threads 
in their waiting state. When the first thread gets done, the object passes the lock 
onto the next thread with the highest priority.

Example1:
<i>class Thread3 extends Thread {
 static String message[] = {"Java","is","hot,","aromatic,","and",
  "invigorating."};
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  Thread3 thread1 = new Thread3("thread1: ");
  Thread3 thread2 = new Thread3("thread2: ");
  // invokes Thread's start method which in turn invokes its abstract run method
  thread1.start();
  thread2.start();
  boolean thread1IsAlive = true;
  boolean thread2IsAlive = true;
  do {
   if(thread1IsAlive && !thread1.isAlive()){
    thread1IsAlive = false;
    System.out.println("Thread 1 is dead.");
   }
   if(thread2IsAlive && !thread2.isAlive()){
    thread2IsAlive = false;
    System.out.println("Thread 2 is dead.");
   }
  }while(thread1IsAlive || thread2IsAlive);
 }
 public Thread3(String id) {
  super(id);
 }
 public void run() {
  SynchronizedOutput.displayList(getName(),message);
 }
 void randomWait(){
  try {
   sleep((long)(3000*Math.random()));
  }catch (InterruptedException x){
   System.out.println("Interrupted!");
  }
 }
}
class SynchronizedOutput {
 public static synchronized void 
  displayList(String name,String list[]) {
  for(int i=0;i<list.length;++i) {
   Thread3 t = (Thread3) Thread.currentThread(); // performed casting
   t.randomWait();
   System.out.println(name+list[i]);
  }
 }
}
</i>

Output1:
thread1: Java
thread1: is
thread1: hot,
thread1: aromatic,
thread1: and
thread1: invigorating.
Thread 1 is dead.
thread2: Java
thread2: is
thread2: hot,
thread2: aromatic,
thread2: and
thread2: invigorating.
Thread 2 is dead.

If we delete the syncronized keyword from the method displayList, the new output is:
thread1: Java
thread2: Java
thread1: is
thread2: is
thread1: hot,
thread2: hot,
thread1: aromatic,
thread2: aromatic,
thread2: and
thread1: and
thread1: invigorating.
Thread 1 is dead.
thread2: invigorating.
Thread 2 is dead.
