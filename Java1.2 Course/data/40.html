<b>Networking: </b>

Connecting 2 or more computers using media devices for file sharing, messaging etc. is called
Networking. This concept started from Unix in 1969. Internet is also a network.

Protocols are like languages used for communication purposes. If the same protocol is not 
being used, the computers will not be able to talk to each other.

TCP/IP are 2 protocols that work together. Internet uses TCP/IP for communication. It started
from Unix.

Other protocols:
* Netbeus - Microsoft
* IPX/SPX - Novell
* Apple Talk - Mac

For networks with multiple OS, individual OS will have support for the common protocol.

<b>Miscellaneous: </b>

<b>OSI Layers:</b>
DO NOT THROW SAUSAGE PIZZA AWAY

* Application
* Presentation
* Session
* Transport
* Network
* Datalink
* Physical

This does not exist physically. This is the core of networking. All protocols work under
this system. 


<b>UDP vs TCP/IP: </b>
UDP and TCP/IP are in the same layer, the Transport layer. TCP/IP is more reliable since it 
checks whether the packet has reached its destination successfully or not. In computer terms
TCP/IP is connection oriented and UDP is connection-less. UDP is faster than TCP/IP since
it does not waste bandwidth over acknowledgement. This is used over voice conversations 
like over the net. Keep in mind that TCP/IP is used to connect over the net, but the software
being used like MSN uses UDP to connect to its server.


<b>Client/Server: </b>
Peer to Peer
When there is no central server. All computers are clients and servers as well.

Client/Server situation is when there is a central server that is used as a domain controller
to connect all the computers together.

<b>Socket: </b>

http://www.yahoo.com:80 as a whole makes a socket. A socket has three sections:
* http
* www.yahoo.com
* 80  <-- port number
If any of the above three have an error, you get a socket error as the socket is not complete.

Internet has the following services:
* www - images, animations, html	- Port 80
* ftp - file transfer protocol		- Port 21
* telnet - text only			- Port 25
* email

Each service has an assigned port number. When we type www.yahoo.com, we get redirected 
to the yahoo homepage. This is because port 80 of the server is called. The port numbers
are assigned by the administrator of the server. If the administrator wants he can assign 
port 1000 to www. You cannot assign the same port number to 2 services, this will cause an
error. If you assign 1000 to www, then the socket will be written as http://www.abc.com:1000
The port number shown in the above table are default port numbers that all admins should use
if they want to comply with the norm.

There are 1 to 65350 ports that can be defined. Well-defined ports are from 1 to 1024.
SMTP and POP are also assigned ports.

<b>Domain Name Service (DNS): </b>

Every computer connected to the net has a unique IP address. To connect to a server you have
to use its IP address. When connecting to websites IP addresses are very rarely used. Usually
domain names are used as they are easier to remember.

DNS resolves a domain names (www.yahoo.com) into IP addresses. The DNS server has a database
of all IP addresses for domain names. When a browser trys to connect to a server using its
domain name, a request is sent to the DNS server which then in turn returns the IP address
of the server back to the computer which will now be able to connect to the server directly.

There are approx 8 DNS servers that are categorized by .com .edu .org .gov .net etc.
These DNS servers are owned and controlled by Network Solutions. You can go to the IEEE
site to see the details of how DNS servers are controlled.

When the DNS server gets the request, it first checks whether the domain name ends in .com
.net etc and then redirects the request to the specific server that resolves it.

<b>IP addressing: </b>

On an intranet, you can assign any IP address as long it does not conflict within the
intranet. On the internet this is not the case. IP addresses are administered by InterNIC.
InterNIC has created 3 classes:
				128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1	Subnet Mask
Class A		1 to 126	  0   1   1   1  1  1  1  1	255.0.0.0
Class B		128 to 192	  1   0   1   1  1  1  1  1	255.255.0.0
Class C		193 to 223	  1   1   0   1  1  1  1  1	255.255.255.0
