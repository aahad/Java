<b>method: </b>

They are defined in a class 


 ______________method signature_________
|					|
|					|
modifier returntype methodname(arguments) throws exceptions {
	-------------
	-------------  <-- Method body
}


Example:
public static void main(String args[])  {  }

void <-- means that nothing will be returned

Constructor never returns anything.

NOTE: Main method is static because
1) non-static requires an object to work
2) since there is no object creation before the main method, if the main
   method were non-static, there would be no way to use it.

<b>Creating an Object: </b>

Syntax:
ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName();

ClassName() <---- creates a parameter-less constructor 

An Object can be used to call a non-static (and static) method from a static method.
By itself a static method (eg. the main method) cannot call a non-static method.

You can multiple objects in the same class, calling the same method.

Example:
<i>class temp {

 public static void main(String args[]) {
   temp obj1 = new temp(); // creating object with the class temp reference
   obj1.method1(); // calling non-static using obj1 from static
   obj1.method3(); // calling non-static using obj1 which in turn calls method1

   method2(); // calling static method2 from static main
   temp.method2(); // calling method2 using class temp reference
   obj1.method2(); // calling method2 using object obj1 reference

   temp obj2 = new temp(); // creating a second object
   obj2.method1(); // calling non-static using obj2 from static
   obj2.method3(); // calling non-static using obj2 which in turn calls method1
   obj2.method2(); // calling method2 using object obj2 reference
 }

 void method1(){
   System.out.println("This is Method 1 which is a non-static method");
   System.out.println("To call non-static method from static, we used an object");
 }

 static void method2(){
   System.out.println("This is Method 2 which is a static method");
 }

 void method3(){
   method1(); // Calling non-static from non-static
   this.method1(); // calling method1 using 'this' keyword
   method2(); // Calling static from non-static
   this.method2(); // calling method2 using 'this' keyword
 }

 static void method4(){
   // obj1 and obj2 are defined only for the main method
   temp obj3 = new temp(); // creating new object because cannot use obj1 or obj2
   obj3.method1(); // calling non-static from static using obj1 defined in main
   // NOTE: we could have used obj1 or obj2 instead of obj3

   method2(); // Calling static from static
   temp.method2(); // calling method2 using class temp reference
   obj3.method2(); // calling method2 using object obj3 reference
 }

}</i>


Output:
This is Method 1 which is a non-static method
To call non-static method from static, we used an object
This is Method 1 which is a non-static method
To call non-static method from static, we used an object
This is Method 1 which is a non-static method
To call non-static method from static, we used an object
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 1 which is a non-static method
To call non-static method from static, we used an object
This is Method 1 which is a non-static method
To call non-static method from static, we used an object
This is Method 1 which is a non-static method
To call non-static method from static, we used an object
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 2 which is a static method
This is Method 2 which is a static method

<b>method arguments: </b>

ie. passing values to a method

Example:
<i>class temp{

 public static void main(String [] argu){
	int i = 10;
	int j = 20;

	temp d1 = new temp();
	d1.method1(i,j);

	System.out.println("Value of i is " + i);
	System.out.println("Value of j is " + j);
 }

 void method1(int a, int b){
	a++;
	b++;
	System.out.println("value of a is " + a);
	System.out.println("Value of b is " + b);
 }

}</i>


Output:
value of a is 11
Value of b is 21
Value of i is 10
Value of j is 20


Example2:
<i>class PassedValue {
 public static void main(String args[]) {
  int i = 100;
  modifyMethod(i);
  System.out.println(i);
 }
 static void modifyMethod(int i) {
  i = i * 2;
 }
}</i>

Output:
100


Example3:
<i>// Simple Types are passed by value.
class Test {
  void meth(int i, int j) {
    i *= 2;
    j /= 2;

    System.out.println("Value of i is " + i);
    System.out.println("Value of j is " + j);
  }
}

class CallByValue {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Test ob = new Test();
    int a = 15, b = 20;
    
    System.out.println("a and b before call: " +
                       a + " " + b);

    ob.meth(a, b); 

    System.out.println("a and b after call: " +
                       a + " " + b);
  }
}</i>

Output:
a and b before call: 15 20
Value of i is 30
Value of j is 10
a and b after call: 15 20
